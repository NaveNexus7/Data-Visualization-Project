# CLIENT NAME:Better By Far
# BRAND NAME: Better By Far
# SERVICE: Social Media Platform
###"Better By Far" is the name of a company that wants to start a new Social Media Platform that they want also want to call "Better By Far".
### Better By Far already has received a series of datasets from a previously hired Data Collection team. 
### We now need to help them understand the perspective of the "Students" segment of the Target Customers

# The package provides extensions to ggplot2 for creating interactive and animated graphics using HTML and JavaScript.
install.packages("ggradar")
# This line installs the "ggradar" package using the install.packages() function.
# The package likely provides functionality for creating radar (spider) charts using ggplot2, allowing users to visualize multivariate data on a two-dimensional plot.
library(tidyr)
# Load the tidyr package
library(ggiraphExtra)
# This line loads the "ggiraphExtra" library, which provides extensions to ggplot2 for creating interactive and animated graphics using HTML and JavaScript.
# It allows for the creation of graphs that can be embedded in web pages and support interactive features.
library(ggradar)
# This line loads the "ggradar" library, which likely provides functions for creating radar (spider) charts using ggplot2.
# Radar charts are useful for visualizing multivariate data on a two-dimensional plot, with each variable represented as a spoke.
library(ggplot2)
# This line loads the "ggplot2" library, a powerful and popular data visualization package in R.
# ggplot2 is known for its declarative syntax and ability to create a wide range of static and dynamic plots.
library(tidyverse)
# This line loads the "tidyverse" library, which is a collection of packages for data manipulation and visualization.
# It includes packages like dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, and others, providing a consistent and integrated set of tools for data analysis.
library(fs)
# This line loads the "fs" library, which provides a set of file system functions for working with files and directories in R.
# It includes functions for file manipulation, path construction, and directory navigation.
library(scales)
# This line loads the "scales" library, which is often used in conjunction with ggplot2 to customize axis scales and breaks in plots.
library(readxl)
# This line loads the "readxl" library, which is used for reading Excel files into R.
# It provides functions to import data from Excel worksheets into data frames.
library(dplyr)
# This line loads the "dplyr" library, a key package in the tidyverse ecosystem, providing a set of functions for data manipulation.
# It includes functions like filter, mutate, and summarize for efficient and expressive data wrangling.
library(tidyr)
# This line loads the "tidyr" library, which is part of the tidyverse and focuses on data tidying and reshaping.
# It includes functions like gather and spread for converting data between wide and long formats.
